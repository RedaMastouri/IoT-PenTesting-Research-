# GeoVision Camera Lab

Things (IoT) hacking lab exercise as showcased at RSA 2018, Hack NYC, Hack the Capitol, and multiple BSides conferences.

This lab is for home use only and should not be used on anything other than the local camera to teach concepts around IOT security and defense. UNAUTHORIZED USE INCLUDING USING THIS ON SOMEONE ELSEâ€™S CAMERA IS BREAKING THE LAW.

## Lab Environment Setup
